# How to contribute #

Third-party patches are essential for keeping Puppet great. We simply can't access the huge number of platforms and myriad configurations for running Puppet. We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes that get things working in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Adding New Facts ##

When adding new facts, they need to be added to the [schema](lib/schema/facter.yaml). The fact name, description, and type must be specified in the [schema](lib/schema/facter.yaml).

Learn more about how to contribute in our [Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/puppetlabs/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
